## ESG Problem Statements ##

Problem statement #1:
- May have to use web-scrapping and text analysis.
- Text-based analysis. 
- Emissions impact from different types of organizations (i.e. JPMorgan).
- Want to have have emissions data estimates. 
- Have exact data that we have to use.
- **Questions**:

Problem statement #2:
- Deal with different land plots and deals with geo-mapping. Using geo-location to determine emissions.
- Predict emissions based on different farming data points.
- Potentially using ArcGIS?
- This is a predictive modeling task: have to take into account many different factors (seasons, farming, etc.).
- **Questions**:

Problem statement #3:
- Uses more attributes to determine biodiversity.
- This one we would need to first research heavily TNFD.
- **Questions**:

## Generative AI Problem Statements ##

Problem statement #1:
- Use some type of API from an existing AI or machine learning. 
- Must know how to use APIs.
- Definitely require lot of training, maybe do pre-trained model (Vertex.AI).
- You need to build a UI: needs to be scalable, adaptable, user-friendly.
- We need to work with libraries, etc.
- [Interesting link](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/18d602cc896b11d9cff0cd505c96358d91e9ec58/language/examples/prompt-design/text_summarization.ipynb).
- **Questions**:

Problem statement #2:
- Financial planning chatbot-like application.
- User inputs data and the AI will generate the financial deliverables.
- Need someone with a strong background.
- Can use Streamlit potentially; interesting link [here](https://medium.com/@avra42/build-your-own-chatbot-with-openai-gpt-3-and-streamlit-6f1330876846). 
- Steps: Do user profiles and then develop the products that fits those profiles.
- **Questions**:
- Can we specify the financial services organizations we are interested in?

Problem statement #3:
- No marketing background. among us.
- You want to use generative AI to get marketing content for a specific use case. 
- Domain: emails, advertisements, social media posts, and other marketing materials + call to action.
- **Questions**:

Problem statement #4:
- Text analysis that expands Problem Statement #4.
- Take any financial report such as SEC filings and be able to find the key points + summarize it. 
- Key points: search engine, narrative generation, UI, Evaluation metrics.
- **Questions**:

Problem statement #5:
- Fraud detection and automating it.
- Develop anomalies in a person's spending habits, etc.
- - **Questions**:
