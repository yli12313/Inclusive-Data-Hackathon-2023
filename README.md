**## We Selected: Generative AI Problem Statement #2 ##**

In the financial services industry, customers often face complex decisions related to investments, financial planning, risk management, insurance, and other financial matters. Collaborative decision-making among customers can be facilitated using generative AI techniques to help them gather insights, compare options, and make informed financial decisions.
Develop a generative AI solution that enables collaborative decision-making among customers in the financial services industry.

Deliverables:
* A generative AI model or system that can take input from customers in the fnancial services industry and generate personalized financial recommendations, summaries, or visualizations to facilitate collaborative decision-making.
* A user-friendly interface such as a web or mobile application, that allows customers to input their financial preferences and interact with the generative AI system.
* Documentation and instructions on how customers in the financial services industry can use and benefit from the generative AI solution, including and relevant code or software components.
* Presentation or demonstration of the generative AI solution to showcase its functionality and effectiveness in facilitating collaborative decision-making among customers in the financial services industry.

The solution should leverage generative AI techniques, such as recommendation systems, natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and other relevant technologies, to help customers share their financial goals, risk tolerance, investment preferences, and other relevant information in a collaborative manner. The solution should provide a user-friendly interface that allows customers to input their perspectives, and generate personalized financial recommendations, summaries, or visualizations to facilitate efficient decision-making.
